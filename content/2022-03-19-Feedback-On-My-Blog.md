This blog is completely static, consisting of markdown files that I post to
a github repository, which are pulled, built, and served using Netlify.


While I like static blogs, I also haven't included any way for people to
provide feedback. Assuming that there is at least one person that reads
this blog, I feel like there should be at least something they could
do to get in contact with me.


Today I realized that there actually *is* a way:
you can always make an issue on the blog's [github repository](https://github.com/nsmryan/itscomputersciencetime.com).
This is at least a public forum that will alert me.


I realize that this is not exactly an easy option, but I'm
glad that at least something exists. I welcome corrections, feedback,
suggestions, etc if anyone wants to provide it!
