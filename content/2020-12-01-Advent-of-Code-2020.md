I am doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) again this year!


My code is [available](https://github.com/nsmryan/aoc2020) if your interested.
I'm intending to use multiple languages this year (last year it was all Rust all
the time).


So far I have implemented day 1 part 1 and part 2 in C, Forth, Rust, TCL, and Python.
I will not be keeping up that pace, but it was fun to try them all out. I want to
do some in Zig as well, but for today I kind of bounced off the file system API.


## Language Notes
I had some thoughts about the different language implementations.


In terms of lines of code (language: part 1/part 2):

    * Python: 10/11
    * TCL: 12/16
    * Forth: 25/28
    * Rust: 26/28
    * C: 45/50

I didn't do any extensive performance analysis, but I found that all languages except C
where around 200 ms, and C was about 10 times faster.


This is a little surprising, since Rust should be about as fast as C. I added some 
timers and found that while the program itself is very fast (~2ms actual runtime), the
Rust program seems to load up slowly (perhaps linking)?
I don't know the full story there, except that
the actual calculation is not what is taking the time here.


## Image Viewer
The one other thing to note is that in preparation for AoC this year I wrote a little
image viewer for pgm images in TCL, which uses Tk to display frames at a given rate.
The idea is that whatever language I'm using, I can output a pgm image with multiple
frames visualizing something I might want to see, and then view them with my TCL
program. It was fairly straightforward to write, and runs with a simple tclkit
making it very portable and reproducible.
