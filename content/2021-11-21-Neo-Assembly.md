I found a very [nice introduction](https://mrjester.hapisan.com/04_MC68/) to the assembly language of the processor
in the Neo- the m68k. 

I'm sure the Neo's processor has quite a lot of functionality beyond what it
presented in this tutorial, but they cover the basic instructions.

I am not exactly new to assembly, but this tutorial attempts to help even
the most beginner assembly programmer with the basic concepts, and walks
through the basic concepts, and then each instruction.

There are a lot of examples for each instruction. They discuss uses, edge cases-
its a really helpful introduction. They even give homework to help you decode
assembly listings.


I just wanted to point this tutorial out. It was clearly a lot of work, and
I benefited from this work, so I want to point others to this resource.
