This post is just a thought on the whole "is software engineering" question. Its a
big question, so I'm not attempting to make any sweeping claims, but rather to
relate my own experience.


I do not have an engineering degree, nor a certification, or anything to label
me as an engineer. However, I think of what I do at work as software engineering-
not software development or coding or hacking, but engineering.


The reason for this is that I am an engineer in a purely defacto manner. I work
at NASA within an engineering organization with its own practices and processes
like all the other engineering organizations. We are responsible
for software just as the mechnical group is for mechnical things, the elecrical
group for electrical things, structural for structure, thermal for thermal,
etc.


Within my group, we maintain process documents, we gather requirements which are
reviewed and signed off, we write and run test procedures (also reviewed and signed),
we hold reviews, we document and test and release and all kinds of software activities.
This is different from what I believe is commonly done within a software
organization- its not agile and its not much fun, but software doesn't get
a pass just because its soft.


We are not perfect- far from it- but we do get evaluated (internally and externally)
for conformance with NASA 7150.2C and CMMI processes. We are audited
by a separate software assurance group. We review our own processes and
are responsible for compliance with NASA practices.


In other words, I see software treated like any other engineering discpline,
and in that environment, software acts like an engineering discipline. I'm not
saying that software is exactly like the well established discplines, and I
recognize that there are difficulties when referring to something as
engineering, and that they can differ by country and culture.  Thats why I'm
merely reporting my experience- I am a member in the Flight Software Systems
Branch of the Engineering Directorate of Langley Research Center and therefore,
defacto, an engineer.
