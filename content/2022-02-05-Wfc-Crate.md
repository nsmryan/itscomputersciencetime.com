I wrote Rust bindings for the single-header WFC library by [krychu](https://github.com/krychu/wfc).
My bindings can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/wfc-rs). I plan to
keep them up to date when the C library changes, but it may lag behind some.


I find this implementation of WFC, Wave Function Collapse, to be a particularly simple and
easy to use API, as well as easy to integrate into a project as a single header file.
I wrote the bindings manually to reduce development dependencies, and because the bindgen tools
weren't working for me, but this is very easy for a small API. I did a little Rusty wrapping, but not
much, to expose an API with no 'unsafe' functions.


I had planned on one day implementing WFC [myself in C](https://github.com/nsmryan/wfc_c),
based on the very nice discussion in the paper [WaveFunctionCollapse is Constraint Solving in the Wild](https://isaackarth.com/papers/wfc_is_constraint_solving_in_the_wild/).
I never finished this project, and I'm glad to see someone else make a much nicer and more
complete implementation than I ever planned to do.


Previously in our game I was using the [wfc](https://crates.io/crates/wfc) crate and some of its associated
crates. These crates are very general and powerful, but have a huge number of dependencies.
Removing this crate and replacing it with my bindings to the C library removed around 45 dependencies,
a full 1/3 of all dependencies of the game. For my use case I really just need a way to generate levels
based on a seed, so this is a great improvement.


If you are looking for a small, quick WFC algorithm in Rust, and you don't mind depending on C, check out
my bindings. The real credit goes to kychu for the C library itself.
