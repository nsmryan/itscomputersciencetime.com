[Downgen](https://github.com/nsmryan/downgen) is a small tool for generating levels
for vertical scrolling games. It is inspired by rxi's 
[awesome article](https://rxi.github.io/level_generation_using_markov_chains.html)
about using markov chains to generate these levels.


While rxi used [Lua](https://www.lua.org/home.html) and [LOVE](https://love2d.org/),
I used C and emit a simple gif using [gifenc](https://github.com/lecram/gifenc).


The tool generates images that look like this:

The idea is to take an input level (in this case a text file with '0' and '1'
characters), split it into rows, and map out which rows occur next to which
other rows. I decided to account for both rows that occur after as well
as rows that occur before other rows when checking this.


The, starting with a random row, determine the next row in the image by
which rows in the original image follow (or proceed) the current row.
The likelyhood of choosing a particular next row is determined by how
often it is adjacent to the current row.


This makes is essentially a Markov Chain, and it is stored as a table of
transitions used to determine transition probabilities. Each row is a state,
and the probability of transition from row R0 to R1 is "n / N" where n is the
number of times R1 is adjacent to R0, and N is the total
number of rows that occur next to R0 the original image.


The tool is very easy to build and run- see the github repo for details-
and generates images of a given height, speed, resolution, and with a given
text file as the input level.


Note that this tool only accept '0' and '1' characters, and only
allows widths < 64. This is simply because the rows are encoded
as bitmaps in uint64\_ts.


I will leave this post with a gif:
