I recently translated the [ZForth](https://github.com/zevv/zForth) Forth interpreter
into [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for fun. I would not say that [my implementation](https://github.com/nsmryan/zzforth)
is complete or full matches the original, but the general structure of the dictionary, the word layout,
and the code were written as a translation from the original C.


I will leave my [README.md](https://github.com/nsmryan/zzforth) as the main discussion of the project, but 
I wanted to put something on my blog as well since I did spend a few evenings playing around with this.

Overall, I think Zig shines in this kind of thing. I felt like its more diverse pointer concepts, its 
control over memory and control flow, and generally its slightly extended functionality over C makes
this kind of thing nicer in Zig, while keeping in the general level of language complexity as C.


In principal Zig allows some functionality that C does not (or, doesn't make easy) such as parametrizing
the "cell" type. In zForth you change the type by editing the code, which is a normal C convention, but in 
Zig you could instantiate interpreters with different cell types quite easily.


As a final note, Zig just feels good to program in as a systems language- the easy testing, compile time
asserts and compile time information, the smooth error handling (compared to C)- it all just comes
together and creates a nice practical tool that you use without fighting.
