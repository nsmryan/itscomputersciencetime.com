The second update on books, articles, games, etc.

## C Language Proposal for Bit Utilities

A very interesting proposal to add bit manipulation utilities
such as endiannes conversions, popcount, etc to the C language
standard. This would be a nice addition in my opinion, allowing
built-in, standard ways of doing these operations that are available
to be optimized. 


Currently I do some of these things manually, not
relying on incompatible compiler instrinsics or libraries, but
I would eventually replace this with standard functions if they
existed.

As always, ThePHD is doing interesting and useful work to improve
the situation of the C and C++ languages.

## The Witcher Series

I'm nearly done with book 4 right now, The Tower of Swallows.

## DSP Book

I'm on chapter six of a book on Digital Signal processing.
Its been very good so far, giving enough introduction without
getting too bogged down in details. I feel like I'm finally
understanding some of the things that my coworkers talk about
with electronics, filters, and signal processing.

I have over many chapters to go, so we will see how far I get.
I'm not dedicated to reading or understanding every part, I just
want a better background in this stuff, and I want to get as
far as I am able to.

## Learn VimScript the Hard Way

I'm still making my way through the vimscript book.
I'm on chapter 29 of 56, so slightly more then half way.
